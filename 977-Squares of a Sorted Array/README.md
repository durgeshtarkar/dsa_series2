# Squares of a Sorted Array

**Difficulty:** Easy

---

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, return an array of the **squares of each number**, also sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

---

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
nums = [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]
```

**Output:**

```
[0, 1, 9, 16, 100]
```

**Explanation:**
After squaring: `[16, 1, 0, 9, 100]`
After sorting: `[0, 1, 9, 16, 100]`

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
nums = [-7, -3, 2, 3, 11]
```

**Output:**

```
[4, 9, 9, 49, 121]
```

## Constraints

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
* `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
* `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order

---

## Approach

### Two-Pointer Technique (Optimal)

1. Use two pointers:

   * `left` at the start of the array
   * `right` at the end of the array
2. Compare the squares of `nums[left]` and `nums[right]`.
3. Place the larger square at the **end** of the result array.
4. Move the corresponding pointer inward.
5. Continue until all elements are processed.

This avoids an extra sort step.
